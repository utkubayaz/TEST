      <h1>MY LIFE</h1>
     <p> I was born in Anamur and lived there until I was 19 years old. My mother and my father are teachers. My mother is a primary school teacher, my father is a geography teacher and I have a sister.</p>

<p>Anamur is although there are places of historical interest, long beaches and a clean sea there is no large scale tourism on this part of the coast as the coast road in both directions is winding and really slow to drive..</p>

	<p>My educationstarted in Atatürk Primary School. My mother helped me very much in elementary school. I went to another school 5 years after reading this school.</p>
	<p/>I got started Anamur Anadolu High School in 2011. I have made very nice friendships. I'm still talking with some friends. I was not a good student in high school. I didn't study, so I wasn't successful.</p>
	<p>After the university examination, it was time for preferences. I wanted to be an engineer. because I had to be an engineer in my mind. but I did not know which engineering to choose. I got an idea from my relatives. He suggested me Electronics and Communications Engineering. When I learned the preferences, I learned that I won Kocaeli University. I was glad to have won Kocaeli University. I was glad to have won Kocaeli University.</p>

	<p>I loved İzmit very much because this is a big city and I came from a small city. Another reason why I love Izmıt is that it’s the sea. My dream is to become CEO in a company, and I'm here to fulfill my dream. I'll work hard for that.</p>
